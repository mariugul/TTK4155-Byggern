This is the workspace in VS code for node 1 of the project.
It's a workspace that includes all the folders and files to make it 
easier to just open the workspace and work on the project. In the
workspace we also save the settings for the project like the formatting
style.

The project was developed in VS code in this way and the Atmel studio
project only includes the path to the src and inc files. 
Atmel studio is therefore only used for compilation and upload of the code.
